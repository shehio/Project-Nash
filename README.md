# Project Nash
Years ago, I wrote some code to obtain Nash Equilibria for simultaneous/sequential games. I kept augmenting the repo with simplistic montecarlo simulations, time series analysis, and linear programming methods over time.
The repo is replete with novice programmers' mistakes. However, as I'm getting better in design and my interests are honed, I will contribute back to it again.
The philosophy behind the simplicity of the code in this repo is: Since all the code in this repo is for education and fulfillment purposes, I prefer clarity over unnecessary optimizations.
