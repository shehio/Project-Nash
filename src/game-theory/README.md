# Game Theory
Game theory is the study of strategic interaction of rational agents. The theory was originated by [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) and [Oskar Morgenstern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Morgenstern). In 1994, John Nash was awarded the Noble Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for proving that every game has an equilibrium where no player has an incentive to change their strategy, pure or mixed. Today, game theory is widely used in computer science, evolutionary biology, economics, and policy-making.
